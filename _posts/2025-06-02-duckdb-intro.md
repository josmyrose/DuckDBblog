## What is DuckDB?

DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system designed for efficient analytical queries. It is lightweight, embeddable, and built to handle complex data analysis workloads with easeâ€”think of it as SQLite but optimized for analytics.

DuckDB runs inside your application and can query data stored locally (CSV, Parquet) or in-memory data frames without needing a server or cluster.

## Why DuckDB?

- **In-process & Zero configuration:** No need to manage a database server; it works inside your program.
- **Fast analytical queries:** Optimized for OLAP-style queries involving aggregations, window functions, joins, and large datasets.
- **Seamless integration with Python, R, and other languages:** Easily query pandas DataFrames or R data.tables.
- **Supports Parquet & CSV natively:** You can directly query Parquet files without importing data.
- **SQL support:** Standard SQL queries for those familiar with relational databases.

## How to install DuckDB

DuckDB can be installed easily in Python with:

```bash
pip install duckdb
